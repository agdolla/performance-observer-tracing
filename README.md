# Performance Observer Tracing
Fetch traces from the wild.

The demo [here](https://tdresser.github.io/performance-observer-tracing/) contains a box with a slow click handler, a button to fetch resources, and a button to download a trace, containing the information recorded by a PerformanceObserver.

[Here](sample_trace.json)'s a sample trace.
